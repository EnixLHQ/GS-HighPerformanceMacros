# What are WLM High Performance Macros

WLM High Performance Macros (hereafter abbreviated to HP_) are a series of macros that have been nominated by the community here as the macros you use to get the most out of your character. They are for Min/Maxers and people looking to squeeze every last point of DPS or performance. HP_ macros are not one button win macros and will require some investment by you the player on getting the most out of them.

Think of HP_ macros like the track car versus the street souped up Imprezza WRX. Is the WRX fast yes. Can it perform, yes. Is it as good as a dedicated track car tuned for racing? No. HP_ macros used correctly should out perform a DB_ macro whne used by the right player.

## How are these different to the Draik Bundled Macros
The DB_ macros were developed in Beta/PTR and the classes were evolving and balancing. They were a good place to start and for those getting into the world of GS-E they are a good foundation. Some were writted to be HP_ macros others were written to take some of the tedium out of levelling through the expansion. The DB_ are the lazy one button winners that are adequate to good but may not be great.

## Whats an example of a set of HP_ macros
John Beast Master macros available at https://wowlazymacros.com/forums/topic/bm-gnome-sequencer-enhanced-leveling-raiding/ are examples of HP_ Macros. You don’t just need the macro, you will need time to adapt to using it and getting the most out of it.

## Where are they stored.
The master repository for these is located at here. Around mid to late September the first version of this will be released on Wowinterface/Curse as an addin to GS-E. It will not be bundled with GS-E and will be a separate download. The reason for mid/late September date is that it will allow people to get to 110 and really start bedding in their play style. We will start seeing raid and specialist PVP results. While rotations are clear now there will still be Blizzard tuning things in the beginning of the patch.

## How do I get a macro added to the HP_ set.
You post it here and have the community nominate it as a HP_ macro and have other people confirm it. If there is a consensus that the macro is HP_ worthy it will be added.

## Who can update a HP_ macro?
The only person who will be able to change the detail of a HP_ macro is the author as denoted by the author=”” line in the macro.

## Can I use these now?
YES! you can download this in its current form from the GitHub repository. This collection wont be advertised anywhere else except here till its release mid/late September. After you download the zip with will have a folder in it called GS-HighPerformanceMacros-master. Rename this folder to GS-HighPerformanceMacros in your Addons Folder.
